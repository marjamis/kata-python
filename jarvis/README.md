# jarvis

Thanks to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and [Ashutosh Krishna](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/ashutoshkrris/) for providing the beginnings of this project. The guide that was followed for this project is [Python Project â€“ How to Build Tony Stark's JARVIS with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-project-how-to-build-your-own-jarvis-using-python/).

I've adapted the above guide for Linux, as it was originally designed for Windows, and modified the structure and functionality a bit more to my tastes.
